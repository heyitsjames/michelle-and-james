                  I finally found the ring that was truly Michelle's. After what seemed like an eternity, it arrived in the mail. I got home, opened the package, and held it in my hand. It was as beautiful as her. I knew I had to give it to her as soon as possible. Michelle and I were dating long distance at the time, and she was living in the San Francisco Bay Area.
                  I had a few ideas for proposals, and was waiting for her to come visit in Salt Lake City. I told her I had the ring, and she jokingly said I should come to San Francisco for the weekend and propose to her.<br >
                  So I bought a plane ticket for the next day.</p>

                  This was seriously the best day of my life. James showed up in a white Dodge Challenger, like a knight in shining armor on his white steed. 
                  I loved that car! James planned a spectacularly fun day in the city (locals tend to refer to San Francisco as “the city;” 
                  if you don’t know which city, then you aren’t from around here!). We went to a delectable French patisserie, an exciting 
                  overlook of the city, and to the beautiful Marin Headlands. It was there, with the beautiful vista of the Pacific ocean 
                  in the background, that James dropped to one knee and asked me to be his wife. I cried. He cried. The guy taking the photo 
                  cried. James told me later he picked that spot because he knows how much the ocean means to me. I’ve never felt so loved.</p>
